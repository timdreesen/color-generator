This is a solo project from the 'API and Async JavaScript' course of the coding school Scrimba. The assignment was to build a color scheme generator based on a [design in figma](https://www.figma.com/file/twasy8Bca4hW7gunLFSLoY/Color-Picker?node-id=2%3A1155).
It's using the [Color API](https://www.thecolorapi.com/) to generate color schemes.

## Requirements:

- Build from scratch
- Choose "seed color" with an <input type="color />
- Choose color scheme mode in a <select> box
- Clicking button makes request to the Color API to get a color scheme
- Display the scheme colors and hex values on the page
